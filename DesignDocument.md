## TEAM 2 - DESIGN DOCUMENT



  

#### Introduction

Here is where you motivate some of your own ideas and describe your customer.

#### Product Reviews

Here you discuss other product and how they achieve tasks that relate to your ideas.

#### Project Overview

Here you bring together your introduction and lessons learned from the reviews. What are you doing the same, what is different?

#### Project Architecture

Your overview should lead naturally into your architecture. Here you have to do the best you can if you have limited experience. Decide based on your vision of what your project should be with the understanding that you may have to learn some specfiic technologies later. You do not have specify specific technnology now. If you are going to use an SQL database to store task data, then just say that and use that language on any diagrams.

#### Requirements

Your discussion so far should be causing your to think about deliniating specifific requirements. While I don't want to state that you need some specific number, look at some of the example projects on Ivan Marsik's website to get a sense of scope. If you don't have between one and two dozen requirements, you probably have not done enough work.

#### Use Cases

Your requirments and previous sections should lead to your use cases. How will users use the system? What are the types of users? This sections should include detailed use cases as well as an accountability matrix that ties your requirements to your use cases.
